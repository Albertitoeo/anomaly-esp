	<string id="army_yan_mec_about_tool_1">
		<text>I'm with the military, callsign "Peregrine". We've got troops stationed here to help out with maintaining the equipment. I'm also a part-time technician - if something breaks, I can repair it.</text>

	<string id="army_yan_mec_about_tool_2">
		<text>What's the current situation?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="army_yan_mec_about_tool_3">
		<text>To be honest with you, it's shit. I don't have the tools I need, all thanks to the outstanding supply of the higher-ups. The equipment the Ecologists have got here isn't really making it easy for us, and it's gonna need some higher quality modifications... Managed to get the old receiver here repaired, though it's still spouting a bunch of gibberish. Our guys kicked the bucket at the Army Warehouses a couple of years ago, and it's still transmitting their voices.</text>

	<string id="army_yan_mec_about_tool_4">
		<text>Well, this is the Zone, you never know what'll happen. Anyway, best wishes.</text>

		<text>Who are you?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="meet_povar_army_1">
		<text>The local cook, I guess. I can't even make something simple like an omelette, but somehow that's the assigned role I received in the army. I'm not a real soldier, so they put me here in Yantar. Anyway, they call me Spirit. Usually I take to drinking - it's so depressing around here. And you know... this is the main base of the Ecologists. My officers come here for inspections from time to time, and they don't like me drinking. Last time they were here, they poured my vodka out right before my eyes, bastards.</text>

	<string id="meet_povar_army_2">
		<text>Go on.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="meet_povar_army_3">
		<text>Well, I know that getting ammo around here is rough, especially when Sakharov doesn't even sell any. I can hook you up with some stuff, but only Soviet-era shit, unfortunately. I've also got a few outfits, everything I've managed to steal is mine.
		\nWhat do you say? I can offer you four 9x18 mags or two mags of 5.45 for five bottles, and four mags for ten bottles.
		\nFor ten bottles, I can share one mag of 7.62mm 7N1, or three boxes of 12x70 shot rounds, your choice.
		\nFor fifteen bottles AND 7000 RU, you get three mages of 7.62x54 mm PP rounds. They are quite expensive you know...
		\nAnd for twenty bottles, I'll fetch you an entire Berill suit from the bins. Don't think I'm a scoundrel... it's not that bad, the lion's share goes to the guys. They've left me their equipment in a stash. I'll leave any goods between the hangars outside the bunker. I buy retail.</text>

		<text>Hello, stalker. What brings you here?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="yan_stalker_sakharov_player_query_brain_scorcher">
		<text>What can you tell me about the Brain Scorcher?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="yan_stalker_sakharov_npc_query_brain_scorcher">
		<text>Hmm, well... The field researchers only skirt the edge of the facility, so the little we know is mostly hearsay; second hand. What we do know is its effects. It seems to invade the mind of any who journey too close. The symptoms include migraines, hallucinations, tunnel vision, and without sounding unprofessional, zombification. If I had to give a scientific estimation, I'd call it a remote psi-transmitter, though I'd have to conduct more invasive research before settling on that conclusion.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="yan_stalker_sakharov_player_query_psi_helmet">
		<text>Professor, I need a psi-protection helmet. My task requires me to move through the Brain Scorcher area, and without it, I won't be able to complete it.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="yan_stalker_sakharov_npc_query_psi_helmet">
		<text>I assume you understand the risk of going through these psychically volatile areas, do you?... Oh, alright, I believe you do. You wouldn't ask me about it otherwise. Well, there has been this one model we've been working on carefully, but it remains unfinished, and it lacks final calibrations. We can give you the psi-helmet right now as it is for a humble sum of 10,000 RU, but then you'd have to deal with the risk of using untested hardware! There's one more possibility, though: we can speed up the calibration progress, but that would require us to use more funds, and for you to wait. It would cost you about 17,500 RU. If you are willing to part with such a sum, we'll begin utilizing it immediately to finish our calibrations, which should take approximately two days, give or take.</text>

		<text>If you insist. I am quite certain that your job requires your equipment to be in perfect operational condition... Oh, I nearly forgot: you can always take it back to us for a final calibration. If you feel something is wrong, head straight to us. We can't afford any losses. So, this will cost you 10,000 RU.</text>

		<text>I've decided to let you finish your work. Please calibrate this helmet thoroughly.</text>

	<string id="yan_stalker_sakharov_npc_psi_helmet_1_3">
		<text>You don't know what relief this brings to me and my colleagues. Letting us finish the final calibrations will greatly minimize the risk of injury, and we really wouldn't want to feel guilty of supplying you with untested gear... So, since you've already provided financial aid to our cause, a final calibration should cost you about 8,000 RU, and you'll need to wait approximately two days.</text>

		<text>Indeed it will be. Once we finish working on this helmet, you'll be able to wander around the Zone freely, without suffering the risk of any psi-damage, as its psi-protective potential will be maximized. So... it will be 17,500 RU.</text>

		<text>Anything interesting happening in the scientific community lately?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_yan_stalker_sakharov_life_1">
		<text>Our research into the Night Star artifact has helped advance protective armour. We may see some spectacular results in a few years.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_yan_stalker_sakharov_life_2">
		<text>There is an old hypothesis that Snorks are the next stage of human evolution. Even after procuring tissue samples, the topic is hotly debated.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_yan_stalker_sakharov_life_3">
		<text>We recently conducted some fascinating experiments on Bloodsuckers that...on second thought, it's probably better you don't know.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_yan_stalker_sakharov_life_4">
		<text>As an intellectual, you might appreciate this - our research has discovered that the so called "eye" of the Flesh is also equipped with...olfactory receptors! Not only can they see out their eyes, but also smell out of them! Isn't that fascinating?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_yan_stalker_sakharov_life_5">
		<text>Have you seen the latest batch of mutant samples that were brought in? We've been transplanting as many as we can onto...voluntary assistants. We may be on the verge of starting a craze!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_yan_stalker_sakharov_life_6">
		<text>We've done it! We've finally managed to create the rare Pellicle artifact under laboratory conditions! It is a breakthrough truly worthy of a Nobel Prize!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_yan_stalker_sakharov_life_7">
		<text>Some of our colleages have taken to eating cooked mutant meat as a way to test the effect of mutated protein on the human body. I don't know why they don't simply pay the 100 Rads a visit instead.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_yan_stalker_sakharov_life_8">
		<text>The Urchin artifact has allowed us to make potent anti-radiation medication. Chances are you may have benefitted from our research several times already.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_yan_stalker_sakharov_life_9">
		<text>Progress has been slow lately. All the mutant sounds outside make it difficult to concentrate.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_yan_stalker_sakharov_life_10">
		<text>We're trying to prove that Vortex anomalies are not merely gravitational, but rather spatial and temporal in nature. If so, their artifacts could hold the key to teleportation technologies.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_yan_stalker_sakharov_life_11">
		<text>Moonlight artifacts could well be the solution to the looming global energy crisis. Electro anomalies are a keen point of interest for us.</text>
