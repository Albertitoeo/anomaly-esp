			<text>No, I didn't "find any". Is this some sort of a fucking joke? You gotta hear the growls coming down there first, then you can think about treasures.</text>

		<text>Name's Reefer. Me and the boys arrived here a couple of days ago, all thanks to Sultan. "It's ok boys, that place was abandoned long time ago", "There's nothing to be scared of". Abandoned my ass... We almost got ourselves killed last night when those angry things showed up out of nowhere. We retreated back here, and didn't move since then.
		\nWe are supposed to search for any useful laying around in the place. According to rumors, Strelok had a hideout somewhere here where he kept his stuff around. Why Sultan cares so much? I don't really no. He said he will feed us to pseudodogs if we don't bring anything useful.</text>
