		<text>I am Eidolon. Chosen of the Monolith. I was the one, to restore the Brain Scorcher. With guidance from the Monolith. I sought audience, and was granted. Bestowed with a gift. Clarity of vision, crystal. To protect, to punish. To serve the greatest cause. I scour the Zone in search of dangerous infidels. Ignorant fools who wish to destroy us, destroy the almighty Monolith. I teach them, I preach. With my weapons. My blessed mind. I sense them, as they run and hide. Futile. To no avail, for I perceive. I pursue. I destroy, to protect, in the name of the Monolith.</text>
